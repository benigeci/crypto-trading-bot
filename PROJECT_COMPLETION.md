## 🔧 INTEGRATION GUIDE

### How to Use Enhanced Features

#### Option 1: Gradual Integration

```python
# In your main.py, import new modules:

from multi_api_aggregator import MultiAPIDataAggregator
from advanced_indicators import AdvancedIndicators
from ml_predictor import MLPricePredictor
from advanced_risk_manager import AdvancedRiskManager

# Initialize in TradingBot.__init__()
self.api_aggregator = MultiAPIDataAggregator(self.config)
self.advanced_indicators = AdvancedIndicators(self.config)
self.ml_predictor = MLPricePredictor(self.config)
self.risk_manager = AdvancedRiskManager(self.config)

# In analyze_and_trade():
# 1. Use multi-API for data
price = self.api_aggregator.get_current_price(symbol)

# 2. Add advanced indicators
df = self.advanced_indicators.calculate_ichimoku(df)
fib_levels = self.advanced_indicators.calculate_fibonacci_levels(df)

# 3. Get ML prediction
ml_signal = self.ml_predictor.predict(df)

# 4. Check risk before trading
if self.risk_manager.check_circuit_breaker(balance, starting_balance):
    # Calculate optimal position size
    position_size = self.risk_manager.calculate_kelly_position_size(
        win_rate, avg_win, avg_loss, balance
    )
    # Execute trade...
```

#### Option 2: Full Replacement

Create a new enhanced main bot:

```python
# enhanced_bot.py
from multi_api_aggregator import MultiAPIDataAggregator
from advanced_indicators import AdvancedIndicators
from ml_predictor import MLPricePredictor
from advanced_risk_manager import AdvancedRiskManager

class EnhancedTradingBot:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize all enhanced modules
        pass
    
    def run(self):
        # Main trading loop with enhancements
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot = EnhancedTradingBot()
    bot.run()
```
